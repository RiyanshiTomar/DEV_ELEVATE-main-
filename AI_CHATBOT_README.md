### **Services**
- **chatbotService.ts**: Frontend service for API communication
- **server/api/chatbot.js**: Backend API endpoint
- **Question Context Creation**: Builds problem-specific prompts
- **Code Analysis**: Specialized functions for code review
- **Progressive Hints**: Level-based hint system

## üîß Setup Instructions

### **1. Backend Setup**

#### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### **Configure Environment**
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

#### **Start the Backend Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### **2. Frontend Setup**

#### **Start the Frontend**
```bash
# In the root directory
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` and proxy API calls to the backend.

### **3. Usage**
1. Navigate to any coding question
2. Click the "AI Tutor" tab (replaces the hints section)
3. Start chatting with the AI about the problem
4. Use quick actions for common requests

## üéØ How It Works

### **Question Context Creation**
The AI is provided with comprehensive context about the specific problem:

```typescript
const context = `
PROBLEM CONTEXT:
Title: ${question.title}
Difficulty: ${question.difficulty}
Description: ${question.description}
Examples: ${question.examples}
Constraints: ${question.constraints}
Expected Time Complexity: ${question.timeComplexity}
Expected Space Complexity: ${question.spaceComplexity}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You are ONLY helping with this specific problem
2. Provide hints and guidance, don't give complete solutions
3. Explain concepts clearly and step-by-step
4. Analyze code and provide constructive feedback
5. Help identify bugs and suggest improvements
6. Focus on teaching the problem-solving approach
`;
```

### **API Flow**
```
Frontend ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí OpenAI API ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Frontend
```

1. **Frontend**: Sends chat messages to `/api/chatbot`
2. **Backend**: Validates request and forwards to OpenAI
3. **OpenAI**: Processes the request with context
4. **Backend**: Receives response and sends back to frontend
5. **Frontend**: Displays AI response in chat interface

### **AI Training Instructions**
The AI is specifically instructed to:
- **Stay Focused**: Only help with the current problem
- **Guide Learning**: Provide hints, not complete solutions
- **Analyze Code**: Review user code for issues and improvements
- **Explain Concepts**: Teach the underlying logic and approach
- **Be Encouraging**: Support the learning process

### **Quick Actions**
The chatbot provides quick action buttons for common requests:
- **Analyze My Code**: Get feedback on current code
- **Get a Hint**: Receive a progressive hint
- **Explain the Problem**: Get detailed problem explanation
- **Show Approach**: Learn the solution strategy

## üîí Security & Privacy

### **API Key Security**
- **Server-Side Storage**: API key is stored securely on the backend
- **No Client Exposure**: API key never leaves the server
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Request Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

### **Data Privacy**
- **No Logging**: Chat messages are not stored
- **Temporary Context**: Question context is only used for the current session
- **User Control**: Users can reset chat history anytime
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS in production

## üí° Usage Examples

### **Getting Started**
```
User: "Can you explain this problem?"
AI: "This problem asks you to find the sum of two numbers. You're given two integers as input and need to return their sum. The key points are..."

User: "What approach should I take?"
AI: "For this problem, you can use a simple addition approach. Think about how you would add two numbers manually..."
```

### **Code Analysis**
```
User: [Analyzes code button]
AI: "Looking at your code, I can see you're on the right track! A few observations:
1. Your function structure is good
2. You're correctly handling the input
3. Consider what happens with edge cases like..."
```

### **Progressive Hints**
```
User: "I'm stuck, can you give me a hint?"
AI: "üí° Hint 1: Think about what operation you need to perform on the two input numbers..."

User: "I need more help"
AI: "üí° Hint 2: Consider using the + operator to combine the two values..."
```
